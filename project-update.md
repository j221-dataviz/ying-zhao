# Project Update

### Progress
1. I found another Pokemon [database](db.pokemongohub.net) with images I would like to use in my visualization. The images include profile pics of each pokemon and symbols of all 18 types.
2. The other [dataset](https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet) I found provide two important vaules of pokemon: damage per second and total damage output. I am going to merge this dataset with the original one in the pitch.
3. I did some research on pokemon and realized that I made a terrible mistake about the their generation. The generation has nothing to do with evolution. Actually, generation refers to the Pokemon game series, like different seasons of television shows. 
4. I don't think I will visualize all pokemon in the dataset. The visualzation probably will be based on their types. For the example, the Top Ten fastest Ice pokemon.
5. 


### Next Step
1. I think I need to classify all the pokemon by the levels of evolution. Unfortunately, I haven't found any data on that. But how they evolve is accessable online. I think by classifying them woule enable me to create line charts of their performance on different levels.
2. I need to look for more references of visualizaion so I can come up with more creative ideas. So far, the visualtion I could think of are pretty boring, like tables and charts.
3. I need to merge the new dataset I found with the original one in the pitch.
4. Visualize the data with R.

### Problems and Obstacles
I don't think this visualization will be like those news ones. So, there won't be fancy maps. 
Most of the visualization will be categorious instead of continuous which urge me to be as creative as I can be to make things intrigueing.
