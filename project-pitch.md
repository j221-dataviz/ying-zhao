# Which Pokémon Should I Pick?

### GOAL
Pokémon are creatures of all shapes and sizes. There are more than 700 Pokémon inhabiting in the Pokémon universe, waiting for the right trainer to catch, raise and train them. Raising Pokémon is not an easy task. The trainer will let her Pokémon battle with another trainer’s Pokémon to evolve into its strongest form. The goal of my analysis is to help each trainer to decide which Pokémon she should catch and which one to pick in different battle.

### SOURCES
The dataset is available in Kaggle.

### QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS
There are 721 Pokémon in total classified into over a dozen types including Grass type, Fire type, Water type, and Rock type, etc. For instance, a Fire type Pokémon has the edge against Grass type Pokémon but will be at disadvantage against Water type Pokémon. Plus, Each Pokémon is like a soldier with different attack index, defense index and speed index, etc. When each Pokémon evolve into different generations, most of the index will change. 

The analysis aims to answer questions like: Which Pokémon is fastest? During the evolution, which Pokémon shows greatest progress? Which Pokémon has more chance to win Water type Pokémon in the battle? If the trainer only wants Fire type Pokémon, which one is the most valuable to keep?

### SUGGESTED VISUALIZATION
I would like to create a series of charts to show performance of each Pokémon in the battle, the distribution of different types of Pokémon, and the variation in each type, etc.
